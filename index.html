          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Oman has a long history. Archaeological research has found evidence
            of civilisation in the Sultanate as long ago as 3,000 years BCE. By
            2,500 years BCE the region was renowned for its metalworking, with
            traders in reed boats voyaging from Oman to what is now Pakistan and
            Iraq. A lucrative trade in frankincense with ancient Egypt, Rome,
            Jerusalem and Bethlehem, both overland and by sea, saw the creation
            of ports like Sumhuram where the Queen of Sheba had a palace. After
            Oman embraced Islam in the 7th century, the country became a
            dominant maritime power with trade routes extending as far as Africa
            to the south, and India and China to the east.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the 15th century ships like Jewel of Muscat, an Omani
            reconstruction of a traditional Arab trading vessel – the kind of
            ship Sindbad would have used – were making regular trading voyages
            to ports like Guangzhou (Canton) in China. But Oman’s strategically
            important location on the Indian Ocean at the entrance of the Gulf
            also made it a valuable prize for successive empire builders.
            However, throughout its long history Oman has never been a colony.
            It has always maintained its essential sovereignty and independence,
            even if at certain periods foreign powers controlled some coastal
            areas in a bid to protect their trade routes. Thus in the 16th
            century Muscat was seized by Portugal, which held the city until
            1650. Following their expulsion, Oman expanded its influence down
            the coast of East Africa. For a time, Zanzibar became Oman’s capital
            and the Sultan’s main palace was located there.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the 18th century Ahmad ibn Said drove out Persian invaders
            and became the elected Imam, establishing the dynasty that still
            rules Oman today. After signing a treaty of friendship in 1798 (the
            first between an Arab Gulf state and Britain), Oman and Britain
            developed increasingly close ties, without the Sultanate ever
            becoming a colony. Around the same period the Sultanate also
            developed relations with France and the Netherlands creating a
            network of trade and cultural exchanges. In 1833 Sultan Said of Oman
            signed a treaty of friendship and commerce with a trade
            representative of the United States, opening the way to a diplomatic
            relationship
          </p>

          <p>
            The discovery and exploitation of oil in the 1920s and 30s marked a
            new era for Oman, but it was not until Sultan Qaboos replaced his
            father in 1970 that the country began to develop an advanced
            economy. After defeating a Communist backed insurgency in the Dhofar
            region in the south of Oman, Sultan Qaboos led the country through a
            period of rapid development with oil revenues invested in education,
            health, welfare and a modern infrastructure. During his 50-year
            reign Sultan Qaboos became an immensely popular figure, widely
            admired as the Father of the Nation. Under the leadership of His
            Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik, Oman is now focussed on building
            for the future – diversifying the economy further. The Vision 2040
            project aims to unlock the human, technological and economic
            potential of the Sultanate to create a more secure, prosperous and
            sustainable future for all Omanis.

          <h2>Geography</h2>
          <p>
            It has a total area of 309,500 square kilometres (approximately
            120,000 square miles). Oman is strategically located in the south
            east corner of the Arabian Peninsula at the junction of Africa, Asia
            and the Middle East. Its long coastline includes regions that can be
            green and habitable, unlike much of the country’s interior which
            lies in the wilderness region of the Arabian Peninsula known as the
            Rub’ al Khali (The Empty Quarter). Traditionally considered as arid
            desert, credible evidence now suggests that there is water under the
            sands. Oman’s varied and attractive landscapes and its unspoilt
            wilderness areas provide outstanding leisure opportunities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the Hajar Mountains the mountain peaks of Jabal Shams (at around
            3,000 metres, the highest peak in the Arabian Peninsula) and Jabal
            Akhdar (Green Mountain) offer dramatic locations with breath-taking
            views and cool temperatures all year round. All this, combined with
            the natural friendliness of its people, makes Oman an attractive
            destination for visitors. The capital Muscat lies on the northern
            coast between the sea and inland mountains. Further north along the
            coast lies Sohar, the birthplace of Sindbad the sailor, a major
            industrial and port city. In the Governate of Dhofar, in southern
            Oman, where seasonal monsoon winds make the region green and
            fertile, lies the coastal city of Salalah, which operates one of the
            most active trans-shipment seaports in the region with a growing
            industrial and free zone hub. In general, the climate is hot and dry
            in the interior and hot and humid along the coast. Summer
            temperatures in Muscat often pass 40C. Winters are mild and
            pleasant, with lows around 20C.
          </p>

          <p>
            Oman’s population is around 5 million, with about 43% non-Omani
            expatriates. Around half the population is aged under 30. More than
            80% of the population live in urban areas, with 50% of the
            population living in and around Muscat.

          <h2>Relief</h2>
          <p>
            Northern Oman is dominated by three physiographic zones. The long,
            narrow coastal plain known as Al-Bāṭinah stretches along the Gulf of
            Oman. The high, rugged Ḥajar Mountains extend southeastward,
            parallel to the gulf coast, from the Musandam Peninsula to a point
            near Cape al-Ḥadd at the easternmost tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
            Much of the range reaches elevations above 4,800 feet (1,463
            metres); Mount Shams (“Sun Mountain”), at an elevation of 9,777 feet
            (2,980 metres), is the country’s highest point. The great central
            divide of Wadi Samāʾil separates the Ḥajar into a western and an
            eastern range. An inland plateau falls away to the southwest of the
            Ḥajar Mountains into the great Rubʿ al-Khali (“Empty Quarter”)
            desert, which the sultanate shares with Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
            These zones can be further subdivided into several unofficial
            regions: Al-Bāṭinah; the mountains and associated valleys of the
            Eastern Ḥajar and Western Ḥajar ranges; the Oman interior area, or
            Al-Jaww (the central foothills and valleys on the inland side of the
            Ḥajar Mountains and the historic heartland of Oman); Al-Ẓāhirah (the
            semidesert plain west of the interior Oman area, next to the United
            Arab Emirates, including Al-Buraimi oasis); Al-Sharqiyyah (sandy
            plains lying east of interior Oman behind the Ḥajar Mountains); and
            Jaʿlān (fronting the Arabian Sea south of Cape al-Ḥadd).
          </p>

          <p>
            The southern region of Dhofar (Ẓufār) is separated from the rest of
            Oman by several hundred miles of open desert. Dhofar’s coastal plain
            is fertile alluvial soil, well watered by the southwest monsoon.
            Wooded mountain ranges, rising to about 5,000 feet (1,500 metres),
            form a crescent there behind a long, narrow coastal plain, on which
            the provincial capital of Ṣalālah is located. Behind the mountains,
            gravel plains gradually merge northward into the Rubʿ al-Khali.

          <h2>Culture</h2>
          <p>
            Oman is an Arab country, and therefore you will not find great
            diversity in religion. Omani people follow Ibadhism which is a form
            of Islam. However, people belonging to different castes also reside
            here but are few. People are strict about following rules and
            regulations and take pride in their country. Arabic is spoken in
            most parts of the country. Dialects of Arabic like Balochi and
            Jibbali are also used. However, in certain areas, you will find
            people speaking Urdu, French or Swahili. English is the second
            language of Oman so, tourists don't face any problem in
            communication. All signboards are written in both Arabic and Engish.
